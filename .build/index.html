							<section class="section" id="agreement-to-arbitrate-and-waiver-of-class-action-claims"><li class='header'>Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims</li>
							</section><p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 10 CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>
							<p>If a dispute arises, our goal is to provide you a neutral and cost effective means to resolve it quickly.  Most disputes can be resolved informally.  Before filing a claim against Lumos Labs, you agree to try to resolve the dispute by contacting us in writing at Lumos Labs, Inc., ATTN: DISPUTE NOTICE, 140 New Montgomery St. Floor 19, San Francisco, CA 94105, or by email to <a href="mailto:legal-dispute-notice@lumoslabs.com">legal-dispute-notice@lumoslabs.com</a>. Before we file a claim against you, we agree to contact you at the email address associated with your CoffeeStrap account.  If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of notice, either you or we may bring a formal proceeding pursuant to the following procedures:</p>
							<p><strong><u>A.  GENERAL.</u></strong> <strong>YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND LUMOS LABS WILL RESOLVE THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO CoffeeStrap OR YOUR USE THEREOF, INCLUDING THESE TOS (collectively, “ARBITRAL CLAIMS”)</strong>, with a few exceptions set forth below.  The arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.<br/> ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT. THE RULES, INCLUDING DISCOVERY, ARE DIFFERENT AND NO JUDGE OR JURY IS PRESENT AT AN ARBITRATION.  IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COST OF LITIGATION, AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED.  THE AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</strong></p>
							<p><strong><u>B.  ARBITRATION SERVICES AND RULES.</u></strong> Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) will administer the arbitration using the JAMS’ procedures and rules in effect on the date the Arbitration is filed (“JAMS Rules”).  In the event the JAMS Rules are inconsistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, this Agreement will prevail.  JAMS is independent from us, and you may obtain copies of the current JAMS Rules, and other related materials, including forms and instructions for initiating arbitration, by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614 1-800-352-5267 or <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>.</p>
							<p><strong><u>C.  FILING FEES.</u></strong> If your claim is for $7,500 or less, we will reimburse you for the filing fee.</p>
							<p><strong><u>D.  LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.</u></strong>  If your claim is for $7,500 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules, and any in-person hearing will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, CA, or any other location you and we mutually agree to.</p>
							<p><strong><u>E.  SETTLEMENT AWARDS AND FEE REIMBURSEMENT.</u></strong> If you prevail, and the arbitrator issues an award that exceeds our best written settlement offer that we made prior to 30 days into the arbitration (or if we did not make a settlement offer before that point), then we will pay you the amount of the award or $7,500, whichever is greater.   Also, if you prevail, and the arbitrator issues an award that exceeds our best written settlement offer that we made prior to 30 days into the arbitration (or if we did not make a settlement offer before that point) and the amount of the award is less than $7,500, we will reimburse you for arbitration fees and your reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>
							<p><strong><u>F.  EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.</u></strong>  As an exception to this Section 10, you may assert claims on an individual basis, if they qualify under applicable rules, in Small Claims court.  Also, either you or we may bring claims to enforce intellectual property rights without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution described in this Section 10.</p>
							<p><strong><u>G.  CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</u> YOU AND LUMOS LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong>  YOU FURTHER AGREE WITH LUMOS LABS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR LUMOS LABS WILL JOIN ANY ARBITRAL CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING; THAT NO ARBITRAL CLAIM WILL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS; THAT NEITHER YOU NOR LUMOS LABS WILL ASSERT AN ARBITRAL CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE; AND BOTH PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
							<p><strong><u>H.  NO RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL.</u></strong>  YOU AND LUMOS LABS ALSO HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL EVEN IF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS HELD NOT TO APPLY.  <strong>YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER PARTY SELECTS ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
							<p><strong><u>I.  30 DAY OPT OUT RIGHT.</u></strong> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and the class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 10 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address:  Lumos Labs, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 140 New Montgomery St. Floor 19, San Francisco, CA 94105, or by email to <a href="mailto:opt-out@lumoslabs.com">opt-out@lumoslabs.com</a>.  For new users, the notice must be sent within 30 days of registering for CoffeeStrap, and for existing users, the notice must be sent within 30 days of the effective date of this policy.  If you do not opt-out, you shall be bound to the terms in this Section 10. If you choose to opt-out, Lumos Labs also will not be bound.</p>
							<section class="section" id="general"><li class='header'>General</li>
							</section><p>(a) <u>Severability and Waiver.</u> If any part of the TOS is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the TOS will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting yours and our intent as closely as possible.  Either party’s failure to enforce any term or condition in the TOS is not a waiver of its right to do so later.</p>
							<p>(b) <u>Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.</u> Except to the extent preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), the TOS are governed by California law without regard to conflict of law provisions.  Except as provided in Section 10, or to the extent preempted by the FAA, both parties further consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the federal and state courts in San Francisco County, California as the legal forum for any dispute between them.</p>
							<p>(c) <u>Change Policy.</u> The TOS may be updated from time to time.  If we make material changes, we will provide advance notice to you either by email, by posting a notification on CoffeeStrap or by posting an updated TOS on CoffeeStrap at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of the updated TOS.  Please note that unless otherwise provided by applicable law, your continued use of CoffeeStrap following the effective date means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the updated TOS.</p>
							<p>(d) <u>Miscellaneous.</u> The TOS are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersede all previous written and oral agreements relating to the subject matter of the TOS.  If there is any conflict between the TOS and any additional terms, conditions, and rules posted by Lumos Labs on CoffeeStrap, the TOS shall govern, unless otherwise indicated.  Sections 2-11 shall survive any termination of the TOS.</p>
